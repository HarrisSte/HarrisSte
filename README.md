# 👋 Hi, I’m Stephanie!
## 🌱 A little bit about me
For the past decade, I've been on an incredible journey as an educator, helping shape young minds and fostering growth in the classroom. My passion for teaching has allowed me to cultivate strong leadership skills, effective communication, and a results-driven approach to achieving goals.

Now, I'm excited to pivot towards a long-standing interest of mine: web development. With a solid foundation in education, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and collaboration in this dynamic field. The tenacity and adaptability I've developed in the classroom have fueled my drive to excel in the world of web development.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to dive into new opportunities, learn from every experience, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. Whether it's untangling complex code or leading a team toward a shared vision, I'm committed to taking things head-on and achieving exceptional results.

I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm ready to embrace it fully as I continue to expand my skills in web development. Let's connect, learn, and create together on this exciting path ahead! 🚀
