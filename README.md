# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephanie!
## ðŸŒ± A little bit about me
Over the past ten years, my heart and soul have been dedicated to shaping young minds in middle school education. It has been an incredible journey, witnessing the growth and progress of my students, and knowing I have made a difference in their lives.

However, life had a fascinating twist for me, leading me to explore my passion for web development. Embracing the unknown, I decided to pursue this new frontier and immerse myself in coding, design, and technology. The transition was challenging, but my decade of experience in education taught me the value of perseverance and hard work. I dove into online courses, coding boot camps, and self-guided projects, constantly seeking to improve my skills and understanding.

I pride myself on my dedication, hard-work ethic, and ambition to ensure that I have met my goals.
